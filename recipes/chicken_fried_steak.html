    <h2>Easy Chicken Fried Steak Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Breaded and deep-fried beef cutlets are known as chicken fried steak
      because of the similarity in cooking method to fried chicken.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups shortening</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless beef top loin</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 quart milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 inch shortening in a large, heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        While shortening is heating, cut beef crosswise into 4 equal cutlets.
        Pound each cutlet thinly with a moistened mallet or the side of a
        cleaver.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together 1 cup flour and garlic powder in a shallow bowl. Beat
        together buttermilk, egg, salt, and pepper in a second shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip cutlets in flour mixture, turning to coat evenly. Dip in egg
        mixture, then in flour mixture once more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook cutlets, one at a time, in hot shortening until golden brown,
        turning once. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
      </li>
      <li>Drain grease, reserving 1/2 cup drippings in the skillet.</li>
      <li>
        Blend remaining 1/4 cup flour into reserved drippings to form a paste.
        Cook and stir over medium heat, gradually adding milk until desired
        consistency is reached.
      </li>
      <li>
        For thicker gravy, add less milk; for thinner gravy, stir in more.
        Season gravy with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Serve over fried cutlets.</li>
    </ol>
